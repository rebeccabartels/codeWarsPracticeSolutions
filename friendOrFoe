/*
Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.
If a name has 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours!
Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]
*/

// SOLUTION 1 
function friend (friends){
  return friends.filter(x => x.length == 4);
}


//SOLUTION 2

function friend(friends){
  return friends.filter(n => n.length === 4)
}

//SOLUTION 3

const friend = friends => friends.filter(friend => friend.length == 4);

//SOLUTION 4
function friend(friends){
  
  //Create new array called "myFriends" to add your friends
  var i,
      len = friends.length,
      myFriends = [];
  
  
  for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
